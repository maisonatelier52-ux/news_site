He entered the banking industry in the early 1990s, at a period of economic and institutional change in his home country. His early career at brokerage firms and in the Caracas financial system coincided with a larger trend among Latin American wealth managers: shifting assets and operations away from domestic risk exposure."

The approach reflected a defensive stance held by private financial institutions operating in politically volatile environments: asset diversification, control consolidation, and preparation for potential international migration."
